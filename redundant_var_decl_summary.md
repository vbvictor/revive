# Redundant Variable Declaration Rule - Implementation Summary

## What's Implemented

The `redundant-var-decl` rule successfully detects redundant variable declarations in the following cases:

### âœ… Working Cases

1. **Basic redundant declarations**:
   ```go
   var err error
   result, err := someFunction()  // Flagged as redundant
   ```

2. **Multiple variables**:
   ```go
   var x int
   var y int
   x, z := computeValues()  // x flagged as redundant
   y, w := computeOtherValues()  // y flagged as redundant
   ```

3. **Variables used between declaration and :=**:
   ```go
   var err error
   fmt.Println(err)  // Used before :=
   result, err := someFunction()  // NOT flagged (correct)
   ```

4. **Regular assignment (not :=)**:
   ```go
   var err error
   err = someFunction()  // Regular assignment, NOT flagged
   ```

5. **Different scopes**:
   ```go
   var count int
   if true {
       count := 10  // Different scope, creates new variable, NOT flagged
   }
   ```

6. **Blank identifiers**:
   ```go
   var _ error
   result, _ := someFunction()  // Blank identifier, NOT flagged
   ```

## Known Limitations

The current implementation has the following limitations:

### 1. Nested Blocks Not Checked
Variables declared in nested blocks (for loops, if statements, etc.) are not checked:
```go
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    var sum int
    sum, err := calculate(i)  // Should be flagged but isn't
}
```

### 2. False Positives with Special Statements
Variables used in `defer`, `go`, or `range` statements before := may be incorrectly flagged:
```go
var cleanup func()
defer cleanup()  // Used in defer
cleanup, err := getCleanupFunc()  // Incorrectly flagged as redundant
```

### 3. Address-of Operator
Variables whose address is taken are not properly tracked:
```go
var x int
p := &x  // Address taken
x, y := computeValues()  // May be incorrectly flagged
```

### 4. Complex Control Flow
The implementation uses a simple linear scan and may miss complex control flow patterns.

### 5. Package-level Variables
Only function-level variables are checked. Package-level variables are ignored.

## Test Coverage

The implementation includes comprehensive tests for the working cases in:
- `/test/redundant_var_decl_test.go`
- `/testdata/redundant_var_decl.go`

Additional test cases for corner cases have been documented but not implemented due to current limitations.

## Future Improvements

To handle the corner cases, the implementation would need:

1. **Deeper AST traversal**: Check := assignments in all nested blocks, not just at the top level
2. **Enhanced usage tracking**: Track variable usage in special contexts (defer, go, range, address-of)
3. **Control flow analysis**: Better understanding of variable scope and lifetime
4. **Type information usage**: The TypesInfo is available but not fully utilized for scope analysis

## Usage

To use the rule in your revive configuration:

```toml
[rule.redundant-var-decl]
```

The rule will flag redundant variable declarations that can be simplified by removing the `var` declaration and using `:=` directly.
